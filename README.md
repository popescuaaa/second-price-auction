# Second Price Auction

## Tasklist
- [x] create a file with testcase
- [ ] create a solver class that receives a config file for which algorithm and test to use
	- [x] static version - working 
	- [ ] dynamic version - not working properly - bad result 
	- [ ] static version tests
	- [ ] dynamic version tests
- [ ] cretea tests files with unitt for ux
- [ ] create a comprehensive readme about how I solved the problem



# Solution

This type of auction system can be solved in two different ways: state based transition and global
solution style. 

## Algorithms 
State based transition is a dynamic programming algorithm.


## Testing
### Testcases
